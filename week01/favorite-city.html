        <p>
            I love Las Vegas, Nevada because I was born and raised there. Not just for that reason though. At one time my entire family on my dad's side lived there. It is also the city where I met my eternal companion and where my son was born.

            Las Vegas also has one of my favorite Temples. It is one of my favorites because it is the Temple where my wife and I were sealed for time and eternity 17 years ago. The Las Vegas Temple is also the sister Temple to the Portland, Oregon Temple.
