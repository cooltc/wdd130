        <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Hello, my name is TC (Craig) Connell" width="200">
        <p>Craig Connell (goes by TC) was born at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he began his life's journey. He has embraced a life full of love, faith, and resilience. Married for 18 years, TC and his wife have endured life's challenges and joys together. Their commitment is a testament to the strength of their bond. Their 17-year-old son, born with DeGeorge Syndrome, has been a source of inspiration and courage for the family. Caleb has had numerous surgeries and hospital stays, including a life-changing open-heart surgery when he was just 14 days old. TC's support and determination as a parent have been instrumental in his son's journey. A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout his life, TC has found solace, community, and purpose within his faith. His spiritual journey has deepened his understanding of compassion and resilience. In service to his beliefs, TC dedicated 9 months of his life to a mission in the Montana, Billings Mission, before he had to cut it short due to some medical issues. During this time, he learned the values of empathy, humility, and community as he shared the gospel with others.</p>
